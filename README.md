Personal thoughts and places


Some places keep memories better than people.

I don’t post much anymore.
I prefer to leave things where they belong.

This was taken during a quiet night,
when everything still felt… normal.

Certain places don’t change,
even when people do.
This place always keeps my thoughts safe.
